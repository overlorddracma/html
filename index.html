      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Liam. I am fifteen years old and I live in downtown Baltimore, Maryland. Although much of my time is spent with school-related assignments and commitments, I try to spend as much time as possible with my family, of which I am the oldest of four siblings. <br><br> Schedule permitting, I love to practice front-end web development, as well as sketchbook drawing and digital art. Many of my digital artworks are created using the app Procreate, and often my inspiration comes from school projects. I also enjoy creative writing, volleyball, caring for a plethora of succulents and air plants, obsessing over font choices, friendly debates, and playing/studying for Certamen, a quiz-bowl-styled Latin competition.</p>

      <h2>Coding education</h2>
      <p>I’ve taught myself coding since 2019, and my skills have transformed from simple python print statements to responsive web design. Although I have briefly used resources like freeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy, none have impacted me like Replit, which allows users to write and launch programs in dozens of programming languages. This is where I build all my projects. Using Replit, trial and error, extensive google queries, and many an hour of pondering, I’ve pushed my coding abilities to a level I wouldn’t have believed possible years ago.</p>

      <h2>Portfolio</h2>
      <p>The projects showcased below are written in HTML [Hyper-Text Markup Language], CSS [Cascading Style Sheets], and JS [JavaScript]. Note: Because I work exclusively with web design rather than backend scripts [which power many websites], few of my projects function the way one might expect. Many of these projects are designed as template websites for companies or newsletters as style examples without functionality. At the bottom of each project, I will denote whether the project is a template with the note: [template]. In addition, the denotation: [responsive] indicates that the website is visually styled to fit various screen sizes. If [non-responsive] is denoted, please try to open the link on a laptop. Otherwise, it may not look as intended.</p>

      <h2>Castalia Project</h2>
      <p>I made this website for the capstone eighth-grade project, where students research a specific topic that interests them. I chose to research the History and Use of Color. Part of the project involved using your research to build something, and I decided to code a website which allowed the users to read about my topic while switching the color schemes of the website with the buttons on the side navigation menu.<br>[non-responsive]

    <p>This website helps organize and keep track of the study materials for Certamen preparation using catagorized dropdown menus. It also enables users to check off resources that they've studied, which then save using localStorage. I was inspired to create this because my friends and I used to study every day for this club.<br>[responsive]

    <p>After playing Charades using an app, I thought it would be neat to try to build a Charades website, and so the project began! I had learned from my experience with Mathasaurus [farther down] and this time ended up with an almost perfectly functioning localStorage saving system! I recommend reading the settings page first, and that is where the link will take you.<br>[responsive... except for one phone size]

    <h2>Mayhem | A Two Player Knight Battle</h2>
    <p>This a two player [or one player] knight battle, and was created in the game building language Kaboom JS. I went a little overboard on the dangerous things that kill the player, but it makes it much more fun! [in my oppinion] There are a lot of features, triggered by computer keys or specific actions, and it would be messy and confusing to try to explain them, so I advise you to press every key and jump on everything to see what happens. One note, when the game loads, you have to click on the screen. Otherwise none of the functions work.<br>[non-responsive]

I just remade the subscribe page, but I like the style more. However, it doesn't have all three pages like the origional website did.<br>[responsive] [template]

      <p>This website idea came from a set-design inside joke. It features a company who's sole job is to sell insurance and restoration services for paintbrushes. This is my most polished site and my favorite project to build and write for. Brush Insurance has five pages, and all of them are completely filled out [as opposed to using placeholder text]. This is quite possibly my last multi-page project that is completely filled out, as I seem to have trouble finishing projects.<br>[responsive] [template]

    <p>This website is my best imitation of a picture of Cactus Store website I found on Dribble. Since it was an image, not a website, I had to try to find similar fonts and graphics. I was lucky enough to come across the same cactus image used in the Dribble post. Because of some of the decorative elements, this website would be a pain to make responsive, and I haven't gotten around to it yet.

    <h2>Mathasaurus v3</h2>
    <p>This is math website that quizzes users on their multiplication math facts. I built it to help my younger brother, because at the time he had no interest in learning math facts. Let me explain the progression of Mathasaurus:<br>Version 1 was one of my first ventures into a project that relied on JavaScript, and the result was a annoying, cumbersome, and horrifyingly unwieldy saving system that ended up not working. I was still proud of it though.<br>I came back to it again, and I can't quite remember, but I think I added a timer and made some other minor edits. I'm pretty sure it was in v2 that I messed up my JS file and couldn't figure out how to fix it.<br>Then comes v3, where ended up with a MUCH neater JS file with MUCH less code. And, most importantly, this time I had experience with what I was working with. So here we are, v3!<br>[non-responsive]
